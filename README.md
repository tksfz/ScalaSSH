# ScalaSSH - Interact with an SSH Shell with type safe Scala goodness
This project will aim to provide a strongly typed, extensible way of interacting with ssh via Scala: pwd, ls, apt-get etc will be strongly typed objects, Ls will return a List of files and so on. Doesn't that sound quite useful?

Project currently built with sbt, more to come, still first couple of commits..
